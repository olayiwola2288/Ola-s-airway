                            Government authorities in many countries have now defined restrictions on the type and quantity of liquids that may be carried in hand baggage through the airport, or on flights arriving into or departing from their country.
                            
                            The European Union agreed a policy that brings into line all EU countries. The EU rules on liquids apply to all air passengers travelling from any EU airport, including UK airports, regardless of their destination. Currently, limited quantities of liquids, gels or pastes can be held in individual containers not exceeding 100ml. This may include: • Medicines • Shampoo • Creams • Hair gel, hair spray • Suntan lotions • Toothpaste • Liquid or aerosol deodorants • Perfumes • Cosmetics such as mascara and lip gloss • Water and other drinks, soups and syrups • Other items of similar consistency.

Items must fit in the bag comfortably and the bag must be completely closed. At the airport security search, the plastic bag must be removed from the cabin bag and x-ray screened separately.
